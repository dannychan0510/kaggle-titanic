## Introduction
Hello! I am a working economist and am looking to teach myself data science and machine learning. I plan to delve into these concepts by experimenting with Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" project (http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted).

I will be following several tutorials as I explore these datasets. The tutorials I plan to follow are:

- https://statsguys.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/first-post/

## Key items in this repo
- The **Data** folder contains the data from the Kaggle competition.
- **analysis1.R** is the R script for my analysis of the training dataset.
